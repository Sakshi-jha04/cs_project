This is my Cs final project for the second semester. This project is based on C language completely.

Project Description:

This project is a simple banking system implemented in C programming language. It allows users to interact with 
the system as either employees or customers to perform various banking operations such as opening an account, accessing an
existing account, depositing money, withdrawing money, and editing account details. The program utilizes basic file 
handling techniques for storing and retrieving user data.

Features:

1. Employee Access: Employees can access the database to view all existing user accounts.
2. Customer Operations: Customers can open a bank account, access an existing account using their username and passcode, deposit money, withdraw money, and edit their account details.
3. Password Validation: The system enforces password security by ensuring that passwords contain at least one integer, one symbol, and are at least 8 characters long.
4. Data Validation: User input is validated at various stages to ensure correctness and prevent errors.
5. Simple Interface: Users interact with the system through a simple command-line interface.


Usage:

* Run the program.
* Choose whether you are an employee or a customer.
* If you're an employee, you can access the database or go back to the main menu.
* If you're a customer, you can open a new account, access an existing account, or go back to the main menu.
* Follow the prompts to perform desired operations such as opening an account, depositing money, withdrawing money, or editing account details.
